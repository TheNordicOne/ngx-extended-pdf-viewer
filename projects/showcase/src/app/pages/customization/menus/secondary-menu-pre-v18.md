## Secondary menu (before version 18)

**Important:** This section describes how the seondary menu worked in older versions. The old customizations should still work in version 18+, but I recommend migrating to the new approach because it's both simpler and more flexible.

The secondary toolbar is the menu that opens on the right-hand side. It contains many buttons of the primary toolbar. On small displays, widgets are shifted from the primary toolbar to the secondary toolbar until the primary toolbar fits on the screen. Similarly, when the window size gets larger, many items are shifted from the secondary toolbar to the primary toolbar.
