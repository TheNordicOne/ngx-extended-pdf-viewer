## Toolbar

The toolbar is the black bar containing the buttons above the PDF file.

**Legend:** The red text tells you which id the component renders internally. When you use the component, don't add the id. Otherwise, the id is used twice. In many cases, this causes errors. However, since version 18, most buttons replaced the pdf.js implementation by an Angular implementation, so the ids aren't as important as they used to be in earlier versions.

**Breaking Change in version 22:** Some of the ids have changed: #print is now #printButton, and #download is now #downloadButton.
