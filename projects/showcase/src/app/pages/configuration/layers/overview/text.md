## Types of layers

The PDF viewer always renders the PDF file as a canvas. Often, it also generates additional layers on top of the canvas.

Those layers are
- [Text Layer](./configuration/layers/text)
- [Annotation Layer](./configuration/layers/annotation)
- [PDF Layers](./configuration/layers/pdf)

You don't have to think much about these layers most of the time. However, these layers are HTML divs, and you can manipulate them.
