The text layer is an optional, invisible layer above the PDF document, which is rendered as an image. You need it to

- mark and copy texts
- find texts
- and, to a limited extend and far from being perfect, to modify how texts are displayed.

By default, the text layer is switched off in order to render the document faster. The drawback is that both the find menu and the select tool are disabled until you activate the text layer.
