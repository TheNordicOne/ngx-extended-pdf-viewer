## Tips

When loading a document from an API as a BLOB, Base64 String or a UInt8Array, consider using a resolver. This allows you to do the API call before actually showing the viewer.

Checkout the [Angular Documentation on ResolveFn](https://angular.dev/api/router/ResolveFn?tab=api) to learn more about how to set this up.
