`ngx-extended-pdf-viewer` ships with translation for more than 100 languages and dialects. When you copy the `node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/locale` folder to the `assets/locale folder` of your application, you can select your language by setting the `[language]` attribute. If you omit this attribute, the default locale of the browser is used.

**Caveat**: The attribute "language" is only read when the component is drawn initially. So this demo hides the PDF viewer for a second when you're switching from one language to another.

## HTML

```html
 <ngx-extended-pdf-viewer
  src="/assets/pdfs/BootsFaces_Deep_Dive_1.0.pdf"
  [textLayer]="true"
  language="fr"
>
</ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>
```

## Custom Translations

You can even use custom translations for your PDF Viewer.

To achieve this, copy the `viewer.ftl` file you want to modify from the `node_module/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer` folder into your project, modify it, add a rule to your `angular.json` ensuring the original file is overwritten each time your compile your application.

**Caveat**: Every once in a while, the team at Mozilla or - less frequently - I add a translation. When you modify the default translation, please check the new changes with each major version of pdf.js.

### angular.json
```json
...
"assets": [
  "src/server.js",
  "src/.htaccess",
  "src/favicon.ico",
  "src/assets",
  {
    "glob": "**/*",
    "input": "node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets",
    "output": "/assets/"
  },
  // new rule follows here:
  {
    "glob": "**/*",
    "input": "src/assets/i18n",
    "output": "/assets/locale/"
  },
...
```

### viewer.ftl

French example at `assets/i18n/fr/viewer.ftl`

```

pdfjs-page-scale-actual = Taille r√©elle
# Variables:

pdfjs-page-scale-percent = { $scale } per cent
...
```
