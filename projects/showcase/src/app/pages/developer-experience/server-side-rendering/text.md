Starting with version 16.2.14, ngx-extended-pdf-viewer supports server-side rendering out-of-the-box.

Since version 21.3.4, the showcase uses static site generation (SSG). That doesn't mean the PDF files are generated on the server, but it means you can use ngx-extended-pdf-viewer in a server-side rendered Angular application. If there's a bug, it'll probably show up in the showcase, allowing me to detect and fix it.
